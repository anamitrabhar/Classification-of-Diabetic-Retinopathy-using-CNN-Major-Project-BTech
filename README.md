Project Title - Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy using CNN

Keywords - Diabetic Retinopathy, Convolutional Neural Networks, Gaussian Filters, Image Classification

Abstract - 

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease that develops as a result of diabetic complications and causes non-reversible damage to retinal blood vessels. If not de- tected early, DR is a significant cause of blindness. The currently available DR treat- ments are limited to stopping or delaying the deterioration of sight, highlighting the importance of regular scanning using high-efficiency computer-based systems to di- agnose cases early. Current studies have demonstrated fully automatic diagnosis sys- tems that outperform manual techniques in terms of avoiding misdiagnosis while also saving time, effort, and money. Nowadays, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been set up as an intense class of models of image acknowledgement issues. CNNs are a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks that have been suc- cessfully applied to recognize images. In this project, we aim at providing a concrete analysis of the performance of CNNs given the task of classifying and staging dia- betic retinopathy in colour fundus retinal images. The proposed system classifies DR images into five stages - no-DR, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative DR.
